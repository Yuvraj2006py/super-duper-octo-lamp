Plan Outline

Form fetcher & catalog

Create form_fetcher.py to launch Playwright with workday_state.json, navigate to the provided job URL, wait for DOM, and extract input/select/textarea elements plus any JSON script blocks into normalized field metadata (application_form_fields with name, normalized prompt, type, required flag, platform tag).
Add application_form_fields table (id, job_id, field_key, label, type, required, platform, metadata) with indexes on job_id and platform.
Track platform metadata on jobs (new column or JSON) so the auto-fill executor knows which adapter to use.
General meta mapping

Keep the general_meta block in user_profile.yaml.
Extend writing.py helper to map prompts containing keywords (“year”, “GPA”, “availability”, “work authorization”) to the corresponding general meta values before resorting to LLM.
Ensure generate_drafts returns the normalized question_answer_pairs (with the prompt and answer).
Auto-fill executor & submission

Add LangGraph node auto_fill_executor after approval_gate.
Node loads application_form_fields, matches them to either general/meta answers or the generated pairs, builds the payload.
Calls form_submission_service.py, which uses the same Playwright storage state (plus optional additional states if needed) to fill the form, supports dry-run validation, detects CAPTCHA/blocks, retries up to a limit, and submits.
Submission attempts logged (auto_fill_attempt, submission_result, submission_blocked) with payload/response stored in new submission_packet table linked to application_id.
Jobs/applications gain new SUBMITTED status; automatic success moves status to it; blocked attempts keep status READY_FOR_REVIEW while leaving the packet ready.
Audit/UI/Artifacts

Log form_fetched, fields_cataloged.
Packet builder writes submission_packet snapshot even when auto-submit happens.
Dashboard job detail shows field catalog + answer source, submission history, and general metadata panel; includes a “Retry submission” button.
Docs & Tests

Update docs (workflows/security/assumptions) with new flow, session handling, and CAPTCHA policy.
Tests: unit coverage for form fetcher extraction, deterministic answers, submission retry behavior; integration mocks for successful submission and CAPTCHA block; update make run_demo to run against the mock form and verify pipeline reaches SUBMITTED
